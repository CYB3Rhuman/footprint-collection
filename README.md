# My footprint collection

I'm planning to make my own footprint collection with blackjack and hookers.

Everything is done in [fped](https://github.com/bert/fped).

## Scripts

If you are editing *.fpd* files with fped, run `clean.sh` to delete it's backups. Be careful with this script! Only run it when you are sure these backups are useless.

To get KiCAD *.mod* files run `export.sh`, then add generated module libraries to KiCAD.
